                            <div><p><strong>1.Is Muslim food available throughout the tour?<br></strong>As double confirmed, Muslim food can be provided throughout the tour.</p><p><strong>2.Which is the better scenery, from beijing or from urumqi?<br></strong>We would suggest you choose the route start from Beijing. Beijing is the political and cultural center of China, it's good to start your Silk Road train trip from here where can give you a deep and overall impression about Chinese culture. The scenery covered by route start from Beijing and from Urumqi is totally same. It also depend on your schedule.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. If I start my tour from Beijing, does it mean that I have to arrange my flight to Beijing? The tour will end in Urumqi. Then do I have to arrange my own transport from Urumqi to Beijing to catch my flight home? What are the transports available from Urumqi to Beijing?<br></strong>Yes, you have to arrange your flight from your country to Beijing if you start your tour from Beijing. The tour will end in Urumqi; afterwards, your return trip will depend on your own travel plan followed. If you decide still go back your homeland from Beijing, you will need to arrange your flight from Urumqi to Beijing (you can book the flight by your own, or we can help you on booking). The transportation available from Urumqi to Beijing includes Train and Flight. If you have other travel plans in China, such as you still want to visit Yunnan, Guilin or Shanghai after the Silk road tour ended in Urumqi, then we can provide proposals on it, and accordingly you can choose other cities such as Shanghai as your departure city back to your homeland.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>What about the bathroom and toilet on the train?</strong></p><p>China Orient Express is the highest-class train in China and is often used for hospitality of national leaders and foreign dignitaries. Right now, there is a whole section of the train is used for shower, and there are total 9 shower rooms in this section. It should be sufficient for customers' need. Moreover, for this 12-day trip, there are only 5 nights that travelers will stay overnight on the train, the rest will all stay overnight in 5-star hotels, and no more than two consecutive nights on the train.</p><p><strong>5. Which category or tier is this trip is under in terms of difficulty (Tier 1 for easy and minimum walking up to 1 km to Tier 3 for energetic and hill trekking up to 3 km?)<br></strong>We would say, for elderly people, it may among tier 1 and tier 2. If you take a look at our itinerary, all the attractions covered don't need long distance trekking such as Forbidden City, Shaolin Temple, Terracotta Warriors Museum. For some places, the altitude maybe a little bit higher than plain, but don't worry, the highest point will be only about 1920 meters high above the sea level ( which is for the boat tour in Heaven Lake on Tianshan mountain), and the forest over there is very dense and the oxygen content is really sufficient.</p><p><strong>6. What is the age profile of the travelers?<br></strong>This tour is very suitable for middle and old aged travelers. As a matter of fact, most of the travelers between the ages of 50-65.</p><p><strong>7. Is internet access available and complimentary in the China Orient Express?<br></strong>Yes, free WIFI access is available in the bar &amp; entertainment car of the train.</p></div>
